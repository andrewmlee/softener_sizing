# softener_sizing
This project is used to calculate water hardness for water softener sizing. It uses data from the USGS to determine calcium carbonate levels measured in PPM. 

## Getting Started
To get started you will need to download water quality samples from the USGS.gov website. This can be added to a database or a .csv file. In this sample we use a .csv file, with the columns used zipcode and calcium carbonate PPM. 

### Prerequisites
 - python 3
 - pandas
